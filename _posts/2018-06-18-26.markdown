## Culture, design and team
### Edoardo Benedetto -- Co-Founder of [Oval Money](https://www.ovalmoney.com) and Starteed

Oval Money was conceived from the union of heart, mind and skills of 4 entrepreneurs diverse in culture and experience ðŸ¤Ÿ To Oval I brought design and the desire to innovate linked to it ðŸŽ¨ I have always believed in solving problems through design and am firmly convinced it must be the driver and the foundation of each product, combined with a team motivated to grow with the challenges that doing business puts you in front of every day

## Bank to the future
### Nicola Parrello -- Frontend developer at [Bunq](https://www.bunq.com)

With fintech companies growing everywhere around the world, traditional banks need to choose where to stand. In a journey through PSD2, APIs and service integration weâ€™ll see what possibilities lie ahead when banks stop behaving like banks. P.S. weâ€™ll have a few tech demos too!
