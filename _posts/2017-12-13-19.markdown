## "How Design should be more like programming and vice-versa"
### Filippo Andolfattoâ€‹ â€“ User Experience & UI Designer at Pinkstratdesign.com

Being able to design and develop products and keeping them consistent along the process it's tough! There are hundreds of thousands of decisions that your team needs to take every single day and without a clear design framework to rely on you'll probably have an inconsistent and hard-to-use outcome ðŸ¤– In the same way, your product will be hard to develop, maintain and it'll cost you a lot of $$$ ðŸ’°<br/>
During the talk, there will be an overview on how to create a design system and how this will help your whole team in developing new products. Moreover, we will discover what developers can teach to designers about product design and vice-versa
