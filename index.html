  <h4>Dimension</h4>
  <p>We&rsquo;re looking for two people to join our team, specifically suited for two areas of great interest:&nbsp;<strong>Artificial Intelligence&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Blockchain</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>The AI developer will primarily work on research on NLP and Conversational Interfaces.<br /></strong>We strongly believe that, in the near future, the most prominent interface to interact with machines is going to be our own voice, and we want to be ready for it.&nbsp;As our AI dev, you will partner with a Senior member of our team to identify the best tools, techniques and procedures to implement in prototypes that will&nbsp;<em>wow&nbsp;</em>the users.&nbsp;If AI is your game, why don&rsquo;t you show us your best Telegram Chatbot, or Alexa / Google Assistant skill?</p>
  <p><strong>The Blockchain developer will primarily work on Blockchain and Smart Contracts.</strong><br />We believe blockchain is one of the most incredible innovations since the Internet, but its future holds balance on the usage it will have.&nbsp;As our Blockchain dev, you will partner with a Senior member of our team to study and improve the depth of knowledge of this tech. You will work on public and private networks, will create POC and <span>&ETH;Apps</span>, and will configure nodes and build tokens.&nbsp;If you believe in Blockchain as much as we do, why don&rsquo;t you tell us, in 3 minutes, how does a BitCoin transaction work?&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Some generic (but fundamental) pre-requisites:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>You must be fluent in the major programming languages, and be able to learn new ones.&nbsp;We primarily use&nbsp;<strong>C#, Java, Swift, NodeJS</strong>.</li>
  <li>You need to have a&nbsp;<strong>working knowledge of the English language</strong>&ndash; e.g.&nbsp;<strong>enough to understand a complex, tech-heavy TED Talks</strong>, and be able to hang on StackOverflow without having to use Google Translate (well, not too much).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>We are an&nbsp;<strong>equal opportunity employer </strong>and welcome people from every angle of the world, age, sex, race or religion - but we do need for you to be able to speak and write in Italian.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Since you&rsquo;ll work on undocumented (or very little documented) technologies, you&rsquo;ll have to be able to acquire information autonomously and from different sources, and to&nbsp;<strong>build, test, scrap and rebuild prototypes on your own</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>You&rsquo;ll work with a super-talented team,&nbsp;</strong>which will probably know a lot more than you do on a lot of things, and because of that, expects you to step up and guide them when it&rsquo;s your turn to shine and show your amazing knowledge. The goal is the greater good and the perfect product.</li>
  <li><strong>We&rsquo;d love if you were able to tell your story (and your work-story) with passion,&nbsp;</strong>by writing it down concisely and by building compelling keynotes. You&rsquo;ll be participating in the most important conferences in your field, and we&rsquo;ll love to hear all about it.</li>
  <li>Do you like cooking? Weight-lifting? Netflix binge-watching? Playing LEGO with your kid? We do too! We all have amazing lives, but&nbsp;<strong>we&rsquo;re also all super passionate about what we do</strong>. The person that joins our team is as passionate as us - one that will study his work-topics in his free time anyway, and has the best ideas while singing in the shower.</li>
  <li>The office is based in the fantastic historical centre of Trento, and the retribution package will be defined based on your skills and ambitions. The initial contract offered is a 6 months one, but the prospective technologies will keep us busy for the next 10 years &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>do your best, and we&rsquo;ll build those together.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>DIMENSION is dedicated to mobile development and innovative projects since 15 years. We work for start-ups and big corporations, helping them to realise products and services to sustain their different technological business needs.</p>
  <p>Send us your CV / Resume, together with your best cover letter (in Italian!) that tells us why you&rsquo;re the right fit for the job, at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:job@dimension.it">job@dimension.it</a>.</p>
  <p>We&rsquo;ll try to answer to everyone.</p>
