## Be kind!

### Our events are dedicated to providing a fun and welcoming experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. 

We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from our future events at the discretion of the event organisers.

Be nice and respectful. Treat each other as you would expect and wish to be treated!

## Longer version

We are very happy of the friendly environment of Speck&Tech. However, if you feel that there is something wrong going on please contact a member of the Association. If you don't know anyone from the Association, we usually have a person at the entrance of the room. They will meet with you right away and handle the issue immediately.

Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated at Speck&Tech. This includes:

- offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race or religion
- sexual images in public spaces
- deliberate intimidation
- stalking, following, harassing photography or recording
- sustained disruption of talks or other events
- inappropriate physical contact or unwelcome sexual attention

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior must immediately comply. **If a participant engages in any of the aforementioned behavior, we may take any action we deem appropriate, from warning the offender to immediately expelling themm from our events**.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the Association immediately.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all our events and conference-related social events.
